# Yankees Coaching Tree

Network Analysis of the Yankees Coaching Tree

New semester, new challenges - this is the repository to follow along with my work using network science/graph theory to analyze the New York Yankees coaching tree.
You can follow along here as well as at my blog: bitly.com/pbarston.

If you want to follow along/try your hand:

#Yankees Managers Historical.csv is the only .csv you will need to start: the list of New York Yankees coaching staffs throughout their history, courtesy of Baseball Cube. 

#Code contains the code, which will be consistently updated as I move along in the project. 

Let me know what you think!
