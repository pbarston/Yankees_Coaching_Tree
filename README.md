# Yankees Coaching Tree

Network Analysis of the Yankees Coaching Tree

New semester, new challenges - this is the repository to follow along with my work using network science/graph theory to analyze the New York Yankees coaching tree.
You can follow along here with the public code as well as at my blog: https://peterbarston.blogspot.com/

If you want to try your own hand:

#Yankees Managers Historical.csv is the only .csv you will need to start: the list of New York Yankees coaching staffs throughout their history, courtesy of Baseball Cube. 

#Public_Code contains the code you can use. PLEASE NOTE: YOU WILL HAVE TO MANUALLY CHANGE YOUR DIRECTORY ("YOUR DIRECTORY HERE") IN ORDER TO GET THE SUBSEQUENT STEPS.

Let me know your thoughts - interesting to see the evolution of just how connected the modern Yankees coaching staff has become!
